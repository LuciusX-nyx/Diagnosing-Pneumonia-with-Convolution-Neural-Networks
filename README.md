# Diagnosing-Pneumonia-with-Convolution-Neural-Networks
In this paper, we show comparison between different existing convolutional neural networks and a CNN model we built on multiple dataset mainly surround the Chest X-Ray (Pneumonia) dataset. We aim to create a CNN model to better detect whether the patient has pneumonia or not. We compared our model with VGG-16, Densenet, resnet-50, and Alexnet. From the result, resnet has the best performance which it has high accuracy in classification both health lung and pneumonia. To the end, we explore and study multiple neural network architectures and how accuracy of the model is influenced by number of convolution layers, pooling layer, activation function, and also the number of classes within a dataset.
